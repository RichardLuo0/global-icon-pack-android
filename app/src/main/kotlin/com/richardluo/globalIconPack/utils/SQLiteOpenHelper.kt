/* A fork of SQLiteOpenHelper to bypass permission issue. Rewrite in kotlin. 2025/4/14 */

/**
 * A helper class to manage database creation and version management.
 *
 * You create a subclass implementing [.onCreate], [.onUpgrade] and optionally [.onOpen], and this
 * class takes care of opening the database if it exists, creating it if it does not, and upgrading
 * it as necessary. Transactions are used to make sure the database is always in a sensible state.
 *
 * This class makes it easy for [android.content.ContentProvider] implementations to defer opening
 * and upgrading the database until first use, to avoid blocking application startup with
 * long-running database upgrades.
 *
 * For an example, see the NotePadProvider class in the NotePad sample application, in the
 * *samples/ * directory of the SDK.
 *
 * **Note:** this class assumes monotonically increasing version numbers for upgrades.
 *
 * **Note:** the [AutoCloseable] interface was first added in the [android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.Q]
 * release.
