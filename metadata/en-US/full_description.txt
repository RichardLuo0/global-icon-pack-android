# Global Icon Pack
An Xposed module for applying icon packs globally

Some launchers support icon packs, however the icons are usually inconsistent across the whole system. For example, the Settings page and the Recent Apps screen may retain the default icons.
This module is designed to extend the icon packs throughout the entire system.

## Requirements
* LSPosed
* Android 8.1+ (I tested on Android 14, 15. @Mickmick21 tested on Android 10, 12L.)
* Some features require AOSP-like OS

## Installation
1. Install the apk.
2. Select apps in lsposed. It should work for most apps/launchers , depending on the api they use.
3. Open Global Icon Pack, choose an icon pack.
4. Open the three dot menu, click each of `Restart xxx`.

## Notes
### Modes
* Use share mode whenever possible. The provider mode serves as a fallback if share mode doesn't work. Local mode is only reserved for testing and you can't use icon variants with this mode (However it maybe faster if there are only a few icon records).
* If you are using share mode, after uninstallation, you must remove `/data/misc/com.richardluo.globalIconPack/iconPack.db` manually.
* Sometimes system update may reset the permissions of share mode database. It is recommended that you deselect apps in LSPosed, after the update, select them again, and open GIP at least once (to setup the permissions), then click each of `Restart xxx`.
### Tips
* You can long press icon in icon chooser bottom sheet to try as calendar icon.
* In icon variant, the option `Modified` indicates that you have made changes to the icon variants. If enabled, when the icon pack updates, it will only add new icons instead of replacing all icons. Note that this could cause issues if any icon entry is missing in the new version!
### Launcher 3
* If you are using a different launcher3 based launcher, please input its package name into the launcher package name in pixel settings. If it is not launcher3 based, some functions may not work.
* Recent screen will use your default launcher unless you use quickswitch, so you will need to select pixel launcher for that to work.
* Pixel launcher saves its icon database in `/data/data/com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher/databases/app_icons.db`.
### For icon pack developers
* You can create a shortcut record by appending `@` to the end of package name, and shortcut id as classname.

## Known Issues
* If the launcher is slow to boot or crashes, switch to 'local' mode.
* If it says "Please ensure the Xposed module has been enabled first" and you have the module enabled already, try force stopping then restart the app.
* Regardless of the minimum SDK version, you must test compatibility with android versions below 14 by yourself.
